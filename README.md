# 🌟 Object-Oriented and Event-Based Programming

## 📘 Course Description

This course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of **object-oriented (OOP)** and **event-based programming**. It covers fundamental programming concepts such as:

- 🛠️ **Memory management**
- 🔍 **Scope rules and visibility of identifiers**
- 📦 **Structured code and data structures**
- 🌐 **Abstraction**
- 🎨 **Use of JavaFX for creating interactive user interfaces**

The course emphasizes the principles of object-oriented programming, including:

- 🏛️ **Class and object**
- 🔗 **Inheritance**
- 🌀 **Polymorphism**
- 🛡️ **Information hiding**
- 🔧 **Static and dynamic binding**

Additionally, students will be introduced to **functional programming (FP)** 🧮, gaining a foundational understanding of this paradigm.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will:

1. **🔍 Understand Programming Paradigms**:
   - Identify and describe the characteristics of different programming paradigms.
   - Choose the most suitable paradigm for solving specific problems.

2. **⚙️ Object-Oriented Programming**:
   - Structure programs using OOP principles.
   - Identify and implement constituent classes.
   - Use basic UML representations for design (further explored in advanced courses).
   - Document code effectively.

3. **🖥️ Languages and Tools**:
   - Use the **Standard ML** and **Java** programming languages.
   - Gain familiarity with Java APIs.
   - Acquire basic knowledge of OOP constructs in **C++**.
   - Build a foundation to self-learn other languages (e.g., Python, C#) with minimal effort.
