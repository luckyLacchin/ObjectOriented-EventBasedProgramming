# Object-Oriented and Event-Based Programming

## Course Description

This course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented (OOP) and event-based programming. It covers fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Memory management
- Scope rules and visibility of identifiers
- Structured code and data structures
- Abstraction

The course emphasizes the principles of object-oriented programming, including:

- Class and object
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Information hiding
- Static and dynamic binding

Additionally, students will be introduced to **functional programming (FP)**, gaining a foundational understanding of this paradigm.
